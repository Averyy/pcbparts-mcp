# Design Rules Style Guide

How to write the 41 design rule files in this directory. Every file must follow this guide exactly.

## The Expert Filter

> **Every line in every file must pass the expert filter: would a good LLM already produce this without the doc? If yes — cut it. If no — it belongs here.**

This is the single rule that governs everything else. These files exist to fill the gap between "general EE training data" and "experienced engineer reviewing your board." Target **80% expert-only content, 20% common knowledge** (the 20% is structural glue — section headers, cross-refs, brief context for expert rules).

**Cut:** definitions, theory, how things work, textbook formulas, standard specs, vague best practices

**Keep:** specific part numbers, quantified gotchas from app notes, failure modes from real boards, thresholds that aren't in datasheets, decision rules with concrete numbers

Write like a senior EE reviewing a junior's schematic. Not "here's what a capacitor is" but "you picked the wrong capacitor and here's the specific one that works."

**FAILS the expert filter — common knowledge:**
"Common-mode currents flow in the same direction on all conductors, returning through stray capacitance."

**FAILS the expert filter — true but vague, doesn't change a decision:**
"Ceramic caps lose capacitance under DC bias. Derate: use voltage rating >= 2x operating voltage."

**PASSES the expert filter — specific, non-obvious, changes a decision:**
"A 4.7uF X7R 0805 retains only 1.5uF (32%) at 12V bias. Same cap in 1206: 3.4uF (73%). Check Murata SimSurfing at your operating voltage — the 2x derating rule is often not enough for 0402/0603."

No introductions, no motivation, no marketing language, no vague hedging ("may", "consider"). State the rule, the value, the consequence, and the conditions the value holds under. Keep every condition, exception and uncertainty the source states: a number stripped of the conditions it was measured under becomes a wrong universal rule.

## Audience

The reader is Claude — an LLM designing schematics and PCBs. It already knows from training data:
- What every component is and how circuits work (don't explain)
- Standard specs and protocols (don't repeat I2C spec, USB spec, etc.)
- Basic formulas (skin depth, voltage dividers, Ohm's law — don't include)
- General best practices ("minimize loop area," "use decoupling caps" — don't state)

It has access to datasheets via JLCPCB search. It does NOT reliably know:
- Which specific parts to use for a given problem (part numbers, families)
- Quantified gotchas from real app notes (the 187nH -> 13nH loop inductance table, the 6mV TPS3808 hysteresis, the 7.6mm not 8mm SOIC-16 creepage)
- Non-obvious failure modes that experienced engineers learn from dead boards
- Interface-specific component selection (which CMC for USB 2.0 vs USB 3.x)
- The interaction effects that textbooks don't cover (DC bias + aging + temperature on ceramics)
- Concrete thresholds for design decisions ("above 3 Gb/s, simulate; below, rules of thumb suffice")

## File Template

Every file uses these four sections in this order. Do not add new sections. Omit Formulas if the topic has no calculations.

```markdown
# Topic Name

> One-line: when to consult this file.

## Quick Reference

- 3-5 most critical rules, each one line with specific values.
- These alone should be enough for a simple design.
- State each rule once. A Quick Reference item is a rule's short form; Design Rules adds its
  conditions and detail without repeating it, and Common Mistakes adds failure modes.

## Design Rules

### Subtopic A

- **Rule in bold.** Specific values, conditions, and rationale in 1-2 sentences.
- **Another rule.** More detail.

> WARNING: Critical pitfall. State what breaks and why.

### Subtopic B

[Continue with more subtopics as needed.
Simple topics may have no subtopic headings — just a flat list of rules.]

## Common Mistakes

- **Mistake description.** What goes wrong -> how to fix it.
[Every entry MUST add information not already in Design Rules.
Do NOT restate a design rule as "not doing X is a mistake."
Good: a non-obvious failure mode, a specific measurement, a real-world scenario.
Bad: "Not using decoupling caps -> noise. Fix: use decoupling caps."]

## Formulas

[Omit this section entirely if the topic has no calculations.]

**Rule of thumb:** [Default values for the common case]
**Formula:** [The actual equation]
**Example:** [One worked calculation]

## Sources

### Related Rules
- `path/to/related-file.md` -- brief description of what's relevant there

### References
1. Source Name -- Document Title: URL
2. Source Name -- Document Title: URL
```

### Section purposes:

| Section | Purpose | Position rationale |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Quick Reference | Critical rules for the 80% case | Top — strongest LLM attention |
| Design Rules | Full guidance organized by subtopic | Middle — bulk content |
| Common Mistakes | Anti-patterns and failure modes | Bottom — strong LLM attention |
| Formulas | Calculation recipes | Bottom — reference when needed |
| Sources | Related rule cross-links + reference URLs | Last — bibliography, not read unless needed |

## Length

**No line targets. No tiers. No floors or ceilings.**

The only length rules:
- **Don't pad.** Every line must pass the expert filter (see top of this doc). If it doesn't, cut it.
- **Don't grow by repetition.** These files are loaded during design work, so routine text should stay flat or shrink. Replace repetition with conditions and pointers. A topic with 300 lines of genuine expert content can use 300 lines; a rule stated three times can't.
- **Split by topic, not by length.** If a file covers two distinct decision domains, split it into two files. If it covers one domain deeply, keep it as one file regardless of length.

## Units

**Metric first.** Use mm for dimensions, with mil in parentheses where PCB convention is strong.
- "Trace width: 0.25mm (10mil)" — for dimensions
- "4.7K", "100nF", "2.2uH" — for component values
- Use ASCII-safe units: `uF` not `µF`, `kohm` not `kΩ`, `>=` not `≥`
- Use `*` for multiplication in formulas, not `x` (which reads as a variable)
- Use `->` for arrows, not `→` (Unicode)
- Temperature: degrees C

## Rules Format

### Granularity: specific default + conditions

Give a concrete default when the sources support one for the common case, with the conditions it holds for. When the right value depends on the design (timing, load, exact device, fab service), give the calculation or the check instead of a number. Don't force a part or value where only a calculation or the exact device's datasheet can decide.

**Pattern:** "Default: [value] (for [condition]). Use [alternative] when [condition]."

**Bad:** "Choose an appropriate pull-up resistor for the I2C bus."

**Good:** "I2C pull-ups: 4.7K default (100kHz, <200pF bus). Use 2.2K for 400kHz or >200pF bus."

### Kinds of statements

Say which kind a number is, because each fails differently when misapplied:

- **Requirement:** a datasheet or standard says so ("USB 2.0 High-Speed allows ...", "the LDO needs >= 1uF ceramic for stability"). Name the device or standard.
- **Fab limit:** one fab service's capability ("JLCPCB standard 2-layer: 0.1mm trace/space"). Name the fab and service; limits differ between services and change.
- **Recommendation:** a default with the conditions it holds for ("I2C pull-ups: 4.7K for 100kHz under 200pF").
- **Example:** a value measured on one design or test board ("ADI measured 22.8% error on a 0.5 mohm shunt at 20A"). Say it's a measurement; it's not a default for other designs.

### Rule format

Most rules use the bold-rule format:

```
- **Rule statement in bold.** Explanation with specific values and rationale in 1-2 sentences.
```

For critical contrasts where the wrong choice breaks hardware, use DO/DON'T pairs:

```
- **DO:** Place decoupling cap within 2mm of VDD pin. Via to ground within 1mm of cap pad.
- **DON'T:** Route cap trace through a via before reaching the pin — via inductance defeats HF bypassing.
```

Lead with what to do. Use DON'T only when the mistake is common and non-obvious. Rules should be predominantly positive, with conditionals for design-dependent decisions and negatives reserved for common failure modes.

### Conditional rules

Use "if/when" for decisions that depend on the design.

```
- **If dropout < 1V and current < 300mA:** LDO (simpler, lower noise).
- **If dropout > 1.5V or current > 500mA:** Buck converter (thermal limit).
```

### Warnings

Use blockquote for critical pitfalls that cause hardware failure:

```
> WARNING: Never connect USB VBUS directly to LDO input without protection.
> A USB hot-plug surge (up to 28V per USB-IF spec) will destroy most 6V-max LDOs.
```

Reserve WARNING for things that break hardware. Not for suboptimal choices.

## Formulas

The expert filter applies here too. Only include formulas that have a non-obvious term, a gotcha, or that Claude would get wrong. Cut: voltage divider, Ohm's law, LED resistor, basic RC time constant, skin depth. Keep: bulk cap sizing with the 1.21 constant, via inductance with the ln(4h/d) term, watchdog window sizing accounting for clock drift.

Include both the shortcut and the real formula. One worked example, no more.

```
**Rule of thumb:** 4.7K for standard mode, 2.2K for fast mode.
**Formula:** R_pull-up = t_rise / (0.8473 * C_bus)
  - t_rise: 1000ns (SM), 300ns (FM), 120ns (FM+)
**Example:** 200pF bus, 400kHz -> 300ns / (0.8473 * 200pF) = 1.77K -> use 1.8K
```

## Cross-References

When a rule touches another file's domain, give a one-line summary with pointer. Don't duplicate full guidance.

```
- Thermal vias: 0.3mm drill, 1mm pitch grid in exposed pad
  (full via design rules -> `guides/pcb-layout.md`).
```

**Exception:** If a value is safety-critical (e.g., "100nF decoupling on every VDD pin"), repeat it even if it's in another file. Don't make Claude load two files to avoid blowing up a chip.

**No cross-file duplication.** If a rule already exists in another file, cross-reference it -- don't copy it. Duplicates drift out of sync, waste tokens, and make updates harder. The only exception is the safety-critical case above.

## Conflicting Sources

When sources disagree on a value, give the range and the condition each source measured or assumed. Pick a default only when one source's condition matches the common case, and say which. "Conservative" isn't one direction: a larger capacitor, a smaller pull-up or more filtering can break a design (slow edges, overloaded drivers, resonance). Flag the conflict for the user.

```
- **I2C pull-up: 4.7K default.** Range across sources: 2.2K-10K. TI recommends
  4.7K; NXP spec allows up to 10K for standard mode. Use 4.7K unless bus
  capacitance demands lower (calculate with formula below).
```

## Tables

Use tables only for multi-variable decisions where prose would be confusing. Keep to 3-4 columns max.

```markdown
| Dropout | Current | Topology | Why |
|---------|---------|----------|-----|
| < 1V    | < 300mA | LDO      | Simpler, lower noise, fewer components |
| > 1.5V  | Any     | Buck     | LDO would dissipate too much heat |
| < 0V (Vout > Vin) | Any | Boost | Need voltage step-up |
```

Avoid tables for simple lists — bullets are more token-efficient.

## What NOT to Include

- **Definitions and theory.** "Ground is NOT a current return path" — Claude knows this. "Conducted emissions: 150kHz-30MHz" — Claude knows this. "CM currents flow in the same direction on all conductors" — Claude knows this. If it's in a textbook or Wikipedia, don't include it.
- **Basic formulas.** Skin depth, voltage dividers, Ohm's law, LED resistor calculations, basic RC time constants — Claude can derive these. Only include formulas that have a non-obvious term or a gotcha (e.g., bulk cap sizing formula with the 1.21 constant that's easy to get wrong).
- **Standard specs and tables.** IEC voltage levels, USB speed tiers, I2C address ranges — Claude has these from training. Only include a table when YOUR specific values differ from the standard or when the table encodes a decision (e.g., topology selection).
- **Vague best practices.** "Minimize loop area," "use shielded inductors," "place caps close to IC" — these are too generic to change a decision. Instead: "Cap within 2mm. Every additional mm adds ~1nH. A 1.5cm trace shifts a 1.9GHz SRF to 314MHz."
- **Datasheet summaries.** Claude can read the datasheet itself.
- **Tutorial explanations.** No "what is SPI?" or "how does a buck converter work?"
- **History or context.** No "USB Type-C was introduced in 2014..."
- **Multiple worked examples.** One is enough. Two is waste.
- **Long inline citations.** Don't write "[Source: TI SLVA450, Layout Guidelines for...]" in a rule. Cite a number or claim that changes a decision with a short ID matching the numbered References list, plus page or section where it helps: `[3, p.12]`. Full titles and URLs appear once, in References.
- **Padding.** If the topic only has 70 lines of expert content after filtering, the file should be 70 lines.

**The filter in practice — examples from actual files:**

| CUT (LLM already knows) | KEEP (expert knowledge) |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| "Threshold hysteresis: voltage difference between rising and falling thresholds. Prevents oscillation." | "TPS3808 has 6mV hysteresis on sense pin — reflects to just 27mV on 1.8V input through divider. Battery systems need external hysteresis." |
| "Shielding effectiveness = reflection loss + absorption loss." | "2-mil copper foil at 100MHz: 66dB absorption, 88dB reflection. Apertures determine real-world SE, not material." |
| "X7R: -55C to +125C, +/-15% tolerance." | "X7R at 40% rated voltage loses >20% after 1000 hours. DC bias + aging + temp can stack to 50-85% loss." |
| "SPI signals: MOSI, MISO, SCLK, CS." | "MISO series resistor goes at the slave, not the master — slave is the driver. Placing at master leaves full trace unterminated." |
| "Common-mode choke + Y-caps + X-caps = pi-filter." | "No Y-caps on LISN side of CM choke. Y-caps between choke and cable bypass the choke entirely." |

## What TO Include (ranked by value)

1. **Component recommendations** — the single highest-value content type. Claude hallucinates part numbers and picks wrong parts without guidance. Every subsection involving component selection MUST name specific ICs or families with key specs. Pattern: "For [use case]: [part] ([key spec]). For [alternative]: [other part]." Example: "USB 2.0 CM choke: Murata DLW21SN (0805, 90 ohm CM at 100MHz). USB 3.x: DLW21HN — standard 2.0 CMCs destroy SuperSpeed signal integrity above 5GHz."

2. **Quantified gotchas from app notes** — specific numbers that experienced engineers know from measurement, not from theory. "ADI AN-139: L2 ground plane at 0.13mm reduces hot loop inductance 14x (187nH -> 13nH)." "ST AN5686: 1nH ground inductance adds 30V at IEC Level 4." These are the numbers Claude cannot derive and will get wrong.

3. **Non-obvious failure modes** — real scenarios from dead boards. "SSC on USB clock causes enumeration failure." "Oscilloscope probe adds 10pF, pushing I2C bus over 400pF limit — works with probe, fails without." "WB SOIC-16 creepage is 7.6mm not 8mm due to JEDEC metal tabs."

4. **Decision rules with concrete thresholds** — "Above 3 Gb/s: simulate with IBIS. Below 1 Gb/s: rules of thumb suffice. 1-3 Gb/s: simulate only if connectors or vias in path." Not "consider simulation for high-speed designs."

5. **Interaction effects** — things that compound in ways textbooks don't cover. "DC bias derating + aging + temperature on X7R: 4.7uF nominal -> 1.5uF actual at 12V after 1000 hours." "Ferrite bead + downstream cap = LC resonance in the bead's inductive region = 10-15dB gain at the switching frequency."

6. **Layout rules with specific dimensions** — "Cap within 2mm of VDD pin. Via at pad, not via-then-trace. 4+ vias on TVS ground pad." Only include layout rules that affect schematic decisions or that go beyond "follow the reference design."

## Writing Process

1. **Read the extracted sources first.** Source snapshots are in `data/design-rules/rules_sources/{category}/{topic}/`. Base rules on what sources actually say, not general knowledge, and keep the snapshot for every number you cite.
2. **Distill, don't summarize.** Each source contributes 1-3 key rules. Identify what each source uniquely teaches — skip content that merely confirms what other sources already cover.
3. **Resolve conflicts across sources.** When two app notes give different values, give the range with each source's conditions (see "Conflicting Sources" above).
4. **Apply the expert filter (see top of this doc — mandatory before finalizing).** For each bullet point:
   - **Is this a definition, basic theory, or standard spec?** Cut it. ("Conducted emissions: 150kHz-30MHz" — cut. "CM currents flow in the same direction" — cut.)
   - **Would Claude produce this from training data alone?** If yes — cut it unless it carries a specific number, part, or threshold that Claude would get wrong.
   - **Does it name a specific part, measurement, or failure scenario?** If no — it's probably too generic. Make it specific or cut it.
   - **Does removing this line risk Claude making a wrong design decision?** If no — cut it.
   - **Is it restated elsewhere in the same file?** Merge or cut.
   - **Target: 80% of remaining content should be stuff Claude would get wrong without it.**
5. **Component recommendation check.** Every subsection involving component selection must name specific ICs or families. This is the single most actionable content type — it directly prevents Claude from hallucinating part numbers or picking wrong parts.
6. **Check the numbers.** Redo every worked example and unit conversion; `tests/test_design_rule_units.py` checks mm/mil and ps/in pairs in every file. Check conditional claims against the source passage. Agreement between LLMs isn't evidence.
7. **Record what you couldn't confirm.** A claim no source supports is cut or marked as unconfirmed in the rule, never kept silently.

## Scope: PCB Layout Content

Four rule files cover PCB layout topics (`pcb-layout.md`, `signal-integrity.md`, `emc.md`, `dfm.md`). For all other files, include layout rules only when they directly affect schematic decisions — e.g., "use exposed-pad footprint variant" influences part selection, "place decoupling cap within 2mm of VDD pin" affects schematic annotation. Don't duplicate general layout guidance that belongs in the dedicated layout files.

## Tone

Write like a senior EE reviewing a junior's schematic. Not teaching — correcting. Not explaining theory — pointing at the specific thing that will fail and naming the specific part that works. Terse, technical, opinionated within the conditions the source tested. Every line should make the reader think "I wouldn't have known that."
