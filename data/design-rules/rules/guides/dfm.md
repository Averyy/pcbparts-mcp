# DFM

> Fabrication tolerances, IPC class differences, tombstoning prevention, panelization, and assembly constraints.

## Quick Reference

- **Standard minimum: 0.15 mm (6 mil) trace/space.** Budget fabs support 0.1 mm (4 mil) but yield drops. 6 mil saves ~15% on fab cost.
- **Minimum drill: 0.2 mm (8 mil).** Finished hole tolerance: +/-0.08 mm. Via aspect ratio <= 10:1 (board thickness : hole diameter).
- **Get verified stackup from fab before routing.** Fab dielectric thicknesses define trace widths for impedance control. A 4-layer designed at 0.2/1.0/0.2 mm may ship as 0.18/1.1/0.18 mm. JLCPCB's 1.6 mm 4-layer default is JLC04161H-7628 (0.21 mm prepreg); see JLCPCB below.
- **Three global fiducials per board** for pick-and-place. 1-3 mm bare copper circle, no solder mask, >= 3 mm from board edge. Clearance zone must be bare laminate -- copper pour in the clearance zone causes AOI to misidentify the fiducial.
- **Tombstoning prevention: equal thermal mass on both pads.** Equal trace width for >= 0.25 mm from pad edge, no vias within 0.25 mm of pad edge, no silkscreen under 0603 or smaller.

## Design Rules

### Fab Capability

| Parameter | Budget Fab | Standard | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Min trace/space | 0.1 mm (4 mil) | 0.15 mm (6 mil) | 6 mil saves cost |
| Min drill | 0.2 mm (8 mil) | 0.25 mm (10 mil) | Laser for < 0.15 mm |
| Hole tolerance | +/-0.08 mm | +/-0.05 mm | |
| Min annular ring | 0.1 mm (4 mil) | 0.13 mm (5 mil) | Breakout probability -> `guides/pcb-layout.md` |
| Board thickness tol | +/-10% (>= 1 mm) | +/-0.1 mm (< 1 mm) | |
| Via aspect ratio | 10:1 max | 8:1 preferred | Board thickness / hole diameter |
| Microvia aspect ratio | 1:1 max | 0.75:1 preferred | Depth / hole diameter (laser drill). Deeper traps air -> open circuits |
| Board size tolerance | +/-0.2 mm (CNC routing) | +/-0.5 mm (V-scoring) | |

- **2 oz outer copper increases minimum trace/space** due to thicker etch. Confirm min trace/space per copper weight with fab before routing -- designing at 0.1 mm then specifying 2 oz outer causes fab rejection.
- **Blind/buried vias require sequential lamination** -- not supported by all budget fabs (e.g., OSH Park does not support blind or buried vias on any service). Verify with fab before designing.
- **Minimum dielectric thickness: 0.065 mm (2.56 mil)** per IPC 6012 Rev F (September 2023). Lowered from previous revision to facilitate laser drilling of HDI microvias.
- **Drill-to-copper clearance:** finished hole to nearest copper must account for plating thickness and inner layer registration shift. Insufficient clearance causes tangency or breakout on inner layers where registration shift is largest.

### JLCPCB

Published limits in mm, from JLCPCB's capabilities, copper-weight and impedance pages (read 2026-11-03).

| Parameter | JLCPCB minimum | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Trace/space, 1 oz outer | 0.10 / 0.10 (1-2 layers), 0.09 / 0.09 (4+) | Inner layers (0.5 or 1 oz): 0.09 / 0.09. 2 oz: 0.15-0.16 |
| Mechanical drill | 0.15 (2+ layers), 0.30 (1 layer) | 0.10 holes are laser microvias: board <= 1.0 mm, ENIG/OSP only |
| Via hole / pad | 0.15 / 0.25 | Pad = hole + 0.10 minimum, + 0.15 preferred |
| PTH annular ring, 1 oz | 0.18 (2 layers), 0.15 (4+) | Recommended >= 0.25 (2 layers), >= 0.20 (4+) |
| NPTH / castellated hole | 0.50 / 0.50 | Component PTH: >= 0.50 recommended (mask/tin blocks smaller) |
| Via hole-to-hole / pad hole-to-hole | 0.20 / 0.45 | |
| Via-to-track / PTH-to-track | 0.20 / 0.28 | PTH-to-track 0.35 recommended. NPTH-to-track 0.20 |
| Copper to routed edge / V-cut | 0.20 / 0.40 | |
| Silkscreen stroke / text height | 0.15 / 1.0 | Pad-to-silkscreen 0.15 |
| Solder mask bridge (pad spacing) | 0.10 | Black/white mask 0.13; 2 oz copper 0.20 |

- **No-surcharge default at JLCPCB: 0.30 mm hole / 0.45 mm pad vias.** 0.10 and 0.15 mm holes always cost extra, and 0.20-0.25 mm holes do with a pad under 0.45 mm. 3.0-3.5 mil trace/space adds 20% on 4-8 layers (30% at 10+).
- **Solder mask expansion: 0.05 mm per side on 1-2 layer JLCPCB boards.** The capabilities page allows 1:1 openings since its June 2025 LDI upgrade, but JLCPCB's September 2026 mask article still gives +0.05 mm for standard 1-2 layer boards and 1:1 for multilayer. Keep >= 0.09 mm from a mask opening to a neighbouring trace either way.

| 1.6 mm 4-layer, top to bottom | JLC04161H-7628 (default) | JLC04161H-3313 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| L1, L4 copper | 0.035 mm (1 oz) | 0.035 mm (1 oz) |
| L1-L2 and L3-L4 prepreg | 7628, 0.2104 mm, Er 4.4 | 3313, 0.0994 mm, Er 4.1 |
| L2, L3 copper | 0.0152 mm (0.5 oz) | 0.0152 mm (0.5 oz) |
| Core | 1.065 mm, Er 4.6 | 1.265 mm, Er 4.6 |

- **Pick the stackup before routing controlled-impedance traces.** An order without an impedance requirement gets JLC04161H-7628; 3313's prepreg is half as thick, so the same 50 ohm microstrip or 90 ohm USB pair is much narrower. Size widths with JLCPCB's impedance calculator for the stackup you order. Other prepregs it lists: 1080 (Er 3.91), 2116 (Er 4.16); 3313 replaced 2313 with the same thickness and Er.

### IPC Classes

| Feature | Class 2 | Class 3 |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Annular ring breakout | 90-degree acceptable | None allowed. Min external ring >= 0.05 mm (2 mil), min internal >= 0.025 mm (1 mil) |
| Barrel fill (PTH) | >= 75% (50% exceptions -- see below) | >= 75% (no exceptions) |
| Plating voids | Max 5% of holes (1 per 20) | None allowed |
| Min copper plating | 0.02 mm (0.8 mil) | 0.025 mm (1 mil) |

- **Class 2 is the default** for commercial and industrial.
- **Class 2 barrel fill exceptions (IPC-A-610 rev H):** >= 14-lead components accept >= 50% fill if visible lead + surrounding PTHs pass. < 14-lead accepts >= 50% fill with 360-degree wetting + thermal plane connection.
- **PTH drill sizing:** drill hole 0.38 mm (15 mil) larger than lead diameter. Gives 0.19 mm (7.5 mil) clearance per side for reliable paste fill.
- **Class 3 pad sizing formula:** `Pad = finished_hole + 2 * min_annular_ring + fab_allowance`. Fab allowance (drill wander) up to 0.2 mm (8 mil) per IPC-2221. Class 3 requires teardrop via pads.
- **Class 3 IST testing:** D coupons subjected to 6 reflow simulations + 100 thermal shocks. Pass = <= 10% resistance change over 300-500 cycles.
- **IPC 6012 Rev F default surface finish is now ENIG** (was tin/lead). If fab drawing doesn't specify, manufacturer assumes ENIG.

### Panelization

- **V-score:** zero spacing between boards, clean break on straight lines only. Not suitable for curves or thin boards (< 0.8 mm).
- **Tab routing:** minimum 1.6 mm clearance between boards. Routing bit consumes 2.5 mm (0.1 in) of material.
- **Component-to-edge clearance:** depanelization shear force cracks solder joints near V-score lines. Maintain >= 1 mm from V-score to nearest pad.
- **Impedance test coupons:** place in panel border outside routing path -- coupons in routing channels get destroyed during depanelization.
- **Half-holes (castellated vias):** minimum plated half-hole diameter 0.6 mm.
- **Panel utilization:** target > 70% usable area. V-score wastes less space than tab routing. Standard panel sizes: 610 x 457 mm (24 x 18 in), 305 x 457 mm (12 x 18 in), 610 x 229 mm (24 x 9 in), 305 x 229 mm (12 x 9 in).

### Tombstoning Prevention

- **Equal trace width to both pads for at least 0.25 mm from pad edge.** Multiple tracks to one pad and a single track to the other creates thermal asymmetry -> one pad wets first, pulls component vertical.
- **No vias within 0.25 mm of pad edge.** Vias wick solder and create thermal imbalance. Even with identical vias on both pads, solder wicking is unpredictable -- one via connects to different copper on different layers.
- **No silkscreen under 0603 or smaller.** Stacked copper + soldermask + silkscreen height exceeds pad height, lifting the component off the pads entirely.
- **Equal copper connection on both pads.** If one pad connects to a large pour, route both through thermal relief traces >= 0.25 mm long before connecting to copper. Large copper areas act as heatsinks and cause one pad to wet later.
- **Via-in-pad for passives:** even filled vias cause unpredictable wicking. Fill vias or move them >= 0.25 mm from pad edge.

### DFA Component Spacing

- **Chip-to-chip (0402-0805):** 0.25-0.5 mm (10-20 mil).
- **Chip-to-IC (SOT, SOIC):** 0.38-0.64 mm (15-25 mil).
- **IC-to-IC (QFP, BGA):** 2.5-3 mm (100-120 mil).
- **BGA courtyard clearance:** 1.0 mm minimum around BGA body. >= 1.9 mm (75 mil) from any component to BGA, 3 mm preferred for rework and inspection.
- **Parts < 0603:** 0.15 mm clearance minimum.
- **Connectors and crystals:** 0.5 mm clearance plus mating connector clearance.
- **NSMD (non-solder-mask-defined) pads preferred for BGA.** Mask opening larger than copper pad gives more consistent pad size. Do not mix NSMD and SMD pads on the same BGA -- inconsistent solder volume causes defects.

### Solder Mask and Silkscreen

- **Solder mask dam width: >= 0.1 mm (4 mil) standard LPI.** Fine-pitch (< 0.5 mm) pads: verify fab can hold 0.075 mm (3 mil) dams -- insufficient dams cause solder bridging between adjacent pads.
- **Solder mask registration tolerance:** 0.05 mm (2 mil) standard, 0.025 mm (1 mil) advanced. Misregistration worsens with board size.
- **Min silkscreen character height: 0.8 mm.** Min stroke width: 0.15 mm. Width-to-height ratio: 1:5.
- **No silkscreen on exposed copper pads** -- prevents solder wetting.
- Solder mask on test points -> `guides/test-debug.md`.

## Common Mistakes

- **Double-sided SMD without considering reflow order.** First-side components see two reflow cycles. Heavy/tall components may fall off during second-side reflow when gravity reverses. Fix: place heavier components on the first-reflow side so they see only one inverted pass.
- **Copper pour under fiducial clearance zone.** AOI and pick-and-place interpret pour copper as part of the fiducial, causing misalignment of all component placements. Fix: clearance zone must be bare laminate, not just mask-free copper.
- **Designing with 0.1 mm trace/space then specifying 2 oz outer copper.** Thicker copper requires wider etch clearance. The fab will reject or silently widen spacing, potentially breaking impedance targets. Fix: confirm min trace/space per copper weight with fab before layout.
- **Pad size not accounting for drill wander on inner layers.** Inner layer registration shift is larger than outer layers. Class 3 boards with minimal annular ring fail at inner layers first. Fix: use IPC pad sizing formula with full fab allowance, verify with fab's DFM tool.

## Formulas

**Via aspect ratio:**
**Rule of thumb:** Stay at 8:1 or below for standard processes. 10:1 is the hard limit.
**Formula:** Aspect_ratio = board_thickness / finished_hole_diameter
**Example:** 1.6 mm board, 0.2 mm drill -> 1.6 / 0.2 = 8:1 (acceptable). 0.15 mm drill -> 10.7:1 (needs HDI process or thinner board).

**Class 3 pad size:**
**Rule of thumb:** Add 0.3 mm (12 mil) to drill diameter for external pads.
**Formula:** Pad = finished_hole + 2 * min_annular_ring + fab_allowance
**Example:** 0.25 mm drill, 0.05 mm ring, 0.2 mm allowance -> Pad = 0.25 + 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.55 mm (22 mil).
