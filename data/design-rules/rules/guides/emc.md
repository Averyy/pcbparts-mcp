# EMC

> Filtering, shielding, PCB layout, SMPS hot loops, and component selection for electromagnetic compatibility.

## Quick Reference

- **Hot loop area determines SMPS emissions.** L2 ground plane at 0.13 mm reduces loop inductance 14x (187 nH -> 13 nH). Route VIN/return traces through filter cap pads, not around them.
- **Series resistors on simple MCU I/O.** 50-100 ohm on outputs, 35-50 ohm on inputs, at the MCU [7, p.11]. TI excludes memory-bus and oscillator pins; check the signal's timing before adding them.
- **1 mV between two antenna parts** (cables, heatsinks) can fail CISPR 32 Class B. Threshold drops to 100 uV for stricter limits.
- **No Y-caps on LISN side of CM choke.** Y-caps between choke and cable bypass the choke entirely. Y-caps go on the board side only.
- **A single unfiltered wire through a shielded enclosure eliminates ALL shielding benefit.** Every cable penetration must be filtered or have a 360-degree shield connection.

## Design Rules

### PCB Layout for EMC

- **1000 pF to MCU ground on simple I/O that can tolerate edges of 100 ns or slower** [7, p.11]. Outputs and bidirectional pins: cap after the series R (before it, the MCU switches into a short). Input-only pins: cap on the MCU side. Not on oscillator pins; check reset and interrupt timing.
- **All I/O connectors on one edge of the board.** Connectors on opposite edges let cables form loop antennas with the board. Plane resistance is < 1 mohm/square -- digital return currents couple only millivolts of noise, but those millivolts drive cables as antennas.
- **Don't gap the ground plane between analog and digital by default.** Above ~100 kHz return currents stay under their trace, so a gap only forces a detour and a larger loop. Use routing partitions; the rare cases for a split -> `guides/pcb-layout.md`.
- **Power plane spacing < 0.25 mm** for closely-coupled plane pairs with 3+ IC power pins at a given voltage.
- **Never put a ferrite on a ground connection.** Ferrites go on VCC/power inputs only. PLLs and clock multipliers: ferrite on power per IC datasheet, never on ground.
- **The oscillator loop is a major susceptibility point** [7, p.13]. Harmonics of other signals (UART, SDIO, SMPS) coupling into it corrupt the oscillator and degrade RF even with a spec-compliant crystal. TI keeps unrelated parts 25 mm (1 in) away on unshielded, mostly 2-layer boards [7, p.13]; follow the MCU's oscillator layout otherwise. Copper, guard ring -> `misc/crystal.md`.
- **Unused MCU pins:** follow the device's own guidance and its reset, boot and sleep states. TI ties unused inputs to ground [7, p.11], but a pin the boot ROM drives high (ESP32-S3 drives some during USB boot) fights a direct ground: ESP32-S3 recommends a pull-up or pull-down on high-impedance pins instead [9, GPIO].
- **Enclosure slots:** TI's limit is 100 mm (4 in) [7, p.18]; at higher frequencies size openings against the wavelength, and prefer many small holes to one large one of the same area [6, Apertures].
- **Filtering priority order:** (1) signals leaving the enclosure, (2) signals leaving the PCB to other boards, (3) on-board signals with high-impedance loads, (4) parallel I/O with fast edges. Remove filter components one at a time in pre-compliance to identify which are actually needed.
- **Cable ground return ratio:** minimum 1 ground wire per 9 signal wires. For cables > 300 mm, use 1:4. A single ground wire returning all RF energy from a second board creates a radiating antenna path.
- **Stripline traces (buried between planes) produce zero voltage at board edges.** Use for traces routed between connectors -> `guides/pcb-layout.md`.
- **DC power traces carry HF noise.** Clock-frequency currents drawn from power pins often exceed clock-frequency currents on clock traces. Filter every power pin with bypass caps; series R on simple MCU I/O: Quick Reference.

### 2-Layer Board EMC

- **2-layer boards can approach 4-layer EMC performance with discipline:** expand all ground traces to maximum width, fill empty space with ground copper, stitch top/bottom ground at every crossing with vias.
- **Ground fill connection rule:** connected at 2+ points = part of return current grid. Connected at 1 point = floating shield (useless for return current, may resonate).
- **3:1 rule:** length-to-width ratio of power and ground traces between IC and voltage source must not exceed 3:1. Run power and ground directly over each other on opposite layers.
- **MCU ground island:** solid ground area on bottom layer under the MCU, extending ~6 mm beyond the IC outline. Tie bypass caps, oscillator caps, and ferrite bead grounds to this island.

### SMPS Hot Loops

- **Quantified shielding plane benefit (ADI AN-139, 10x10 cm loop at 27 MHz):**

| Configuration | Loop Inductance |
|--------------|----------------|
| Single-layer, no plane | 187 nH |
| L2 at 1.5 mm (2-layer typical) | 42 nH (4.5x reduction) |
| L2 at 0.5 mm | 23 nH |
| L2 at 0.13 mm | 13 nH (14x reduction) |

- **Recommended 4-layer EMC stackup:** L1 signal + components, L2 solid ground, L3 power, L4 signal. L2 provides continuous return path for L1 traces and shields from L3/L4 noise.
- **Keep L2 solid in the hot loop area.** No signal vias punching through. Eddy currents in L2 create HF voltage that couples through nearby vias to other layers.
- **Capacitor ESL:** use short/reverse-geometry caps (0402 preferred). Route VIN/return traces **through** filter cap pads -- any trace between cap pad and power path adds hundreds of pH, negating low-ESL advantage. Stack multiple 0402s closest for lowest combined ESL, larger cases further away for bulk.
- **Complete GND ring** with via fence around SMPS section. Filter cap GND return connects where VIN current crosses the ring -- filtering inductance must remain between ring crossing and hot loop.
- **Keep filtering inductors away from the main power inductor.** Transformer coupling bypasses the filter entirely. Orient perpendicular, place outside the GND ring/via fence.
- **Switch node copper area:** minimize surface area. Large switch node copper is a broadband E-field source. Keep as small as current rating allows.
- **Sense lines** (FB, SENSE+, SENSE-): sub-millivolt noise causes duty cycle jitter. Route on opposite side of shielding plane from hot loops. Gap between SENSE+ and SENSE- traces as small as possible.
- **INTVCC decoupling loop:** RF energy is > 20 dB lower than main hot loop. Still route carefully, but prioritize the main switch node loop.
- **External gate drive loops:** gate currents are single-digit amps with single-digit ns edges. Bottom FET gate loop is supplied from INTVCC cap -- source-GND and cap-GND must share a short, direct connection.
- **Flyback CM emissions:** electric field (not magnetic) dominates across the isolation barrier. Minimize primary-side switch node copper area. Use a Faraday shield in the transformer. CM chokes on primary input are standard.
- **Buck-boost and SEPIC:** two hot loops (buck-side and boost-side) may share a current-sense resistor. Split into two parallel resistors to separate loop GND connections.
- Integrated-switch ICs outperform external Schottky, which outperform external MOSFETs for EMI.
- SMPS topology selection and inductor sizing -> `power/switching.md`.

### Common-Mode Filtering

- **Unbalanced inputs** (e.g., buck converter with VBATT- shorted to ground): do NOT use a CM choke. Filter the driven conductor to chassis ground directly. Make it very unbalanced and filter the high-impedance side.
- **Isolated DC inputs (no chassis ground):** add capacitors between circuit ground plane and chassis ground plane under the connector to emphasize the imbalance, enabling effective unbalanced filtering on the driven conductor only.
- **Balanced systems need balanced filters.** An unbalanced filter on a balanced system forces mode conversion -- DM noise becomes CM, making emissions worse, not better.
- **CM choke core material:** ferrite for broadband (100 kHz - 100 MHz). Nanocrystalline for lower-frequency conducted (10 kHz - 10 MHz) -- higher mu_i but physically larger.
- **AC mains CM filtering:** CMC rated for the mains voltage + safety-rated X and Y caps [12, sec.2]. Larger Y-caps filter lower frequencies but raise ground leakage: size them against the product safety standard's leakage limit. The CMC covers the low-frequency range Y-caps can't reach.
- **Products without a metal chassis:** use lossy CM choke (resistance, not just inductance). Pure inductance creates resonances with the capacitive return path through stray capacitance. Y-caps give power wires low-impedance path to board ground.
- **Small plastic enclosures** with all wires on one edge: DM filtering (pi-filter to board ground) is usually sufficient. CM filtering needed only if cables act as antennas.

> WARNING: CMC dot convention determines whether the coil functions as a CM choke or a normal-mode inductor.
> Dots on the same side = CM choke (flux reinforces for CM, cancels for DM). Dots on opposite sides = NOT a CMC --
> acts as a coupled inductor that blocks differential signals. Verify dot placement against the
> datasheet equivalent circuit for every CMC in the design.

### Shielding

- **Apertures determine real-world shielding**, not material thickness. 2-mil copper at 100 MHz gives 66 dB absorption + 88 dB reflection -- any solid copper is effectively perfect above a few MHz.
- **A shielded enclosure can have SE < 0 dB** (worse than no shield) if poorly placed apertures couple energy to the enclosure, which becomes a better antenna than the original source. Sealed metallic enclosure with no apertures: >= 40 dB. Add one unfiltered cable: 0 dB.
- **Depth-to-width ratio of 3:1 adds ~90 dB per aperture** well below its cutoff (f << fc, depth >> width) [6, eq.2]. It's added attenuation, not the enclosure's total SE, and doesn't apply if a wire penetrates the opening (TEM mode propagates).
- **Cable shield 360-degree contact** to enclosure. Pigtail connections provide negligible shielding above a few MHz.
- **Seams** are worse than apertures due to length. A half-wavelength seam radiates as a dipole. Conductive adhesive tape is not adequate for seams > ~25 mm -- use finger stock or conductive gaskets with continuous contact.
- **Paint/anodize heatsink surfaces** -- radiation accounts for ~25% of natural convection heat transfer, and painted surfaces reduce EMI reflections from internal sources.
- **Magnetic shielding below ~kHz:** conductive shields fail (eddy currents too weak). Use mu-metal or steel. Must divert flux all the way around the object; a plate above/below provides zero magnetic shielding.
- **Near-field magnetic shielding:** a conductive plate between source and victim redirects flux via eddy currents. Effective above ~100 kHz.
- **Galvanic corrosion at shield bonds:** anodic index difference > 0.95V requires plating or conductive gaskets. Aluminum-to-steel is the common offender.
- **Board-level shielding cans:** required when SMPS or clock circuitry is near an RF receiver (GPS, BLE, Wi-Fi). Can must solder to continuous ground ring with multiple vias. Apertures follow same rules -- many small holes, no slots.

### Filter Component Selection

- **3-terminal capacitors** maintain insertion loss to ~100 MHz (vs 2-terminal SRF at ~10 MHz). Route input/output vias on opposite sides of the cap body -- adjacent vias couple capacitively and bypass the filter (performance drops from ~100 MHz to ~10 MHz).
- **3-terminal cap mounting:** "through" connection (pattern cut, cap in series) for best I/O filtering. "Non-through" (parallel, pattern intact) for IC supply decoupling -- halves bypass impedance but some noise passes unfiltered.
- **3-terminal cap families:** Murata NFM series (0402-1210, feed-through, to 100 MHz). TDK YFF series (4-terminal, improved HF).
- **LC composite EMI filters:** Murata NFE61P (0603, LC pi-filter, broadband). TDK MAF series (0402-0805, integrated LC, USB/HDMI). Key advantage: no PCB parasitics between L and C elements. Array-type (4 circuits/package) for LCD/camera interfaces.
- **Ferrite bead LC resonance** -> `guides/passives.md`. On power rails, ADI runs beads at ~20% of rated current (rated >= 5x load) and checks impedance at the actual DC bias [13, DC Bias]. Prefer a lossy impedance curve; sharp-curve beads need a series damping resistor (check its voltage drop).
- **CMC saturation risk:** CMCs with intentional DM impedance can saturate under high DC load. Symptom: filter works at low load, fails at full load. Verify CMC impedance at rated DC current.
- **CMC differential-mode leakage:** all CM chokes have some DM inductance. For USB 3.0/DisplayPort, verify DM insertion loss does not degrade signal integrity above 5 GHz.

### CM Choke and EMI Component Recommendations

- **Signal-line CMCs (USB 2.0, HDMI, MIPI):** Murata DLW21SN series (0805, 90 ohm CM at 100 MHz). Provides skew correction -- transformer coupling realigns edge timing, reducing jitter from trace imbalance.
- **Signal-line CMCs (USB 3.x, DP HBR):** Murata DLW21HN (optimized for > 5 Gbps). TDK ACM series (low DM loss to 10 GHz).
- **Power-line CMCs (DC bus, SMPS input):** If DC bus > 6A or need nanocrystalline for low-frequency CM noise: Wurth WE-CMB (through-hole, 1-30A, MnZn or nanocrystalline). If SMD and <= 6A: TDK ACT series (ferrite, smaller footprint).
- **AC mains line filters (integrated CMC + X/Y caps):** If pre-certified module needed to skip filter compliance iteration: Schaffner FN series (widest range of current/voltage ratings). If space-constrained or need board-mount IEC inlet combo: Schurter 5500 series (integrated inlet + fuse + filter).

### Interface-Specific EMI Filtering

- **USB 2.0 data lines:** a CMC (Murata DLW21SN, 90 ohm at 100 MHz) near the connector, after ESD, only if EMI needs it [11, items 1.08-1.09]. Shunt caps depend on speed: FTDI allows optional 47 pF C0G on Full-Speed parts (FT2xxB/R/X, FT2232D) but 0-10 pF on High-Speed FTx232H [10, sec.2.3]; TI caps total external discrete capacitance at 4 pF per line for High-Speed [11, item 1.06]. ESD -> `protection/esd.md`.
- **USB hub ports:** one CMC per port. Shared CMCs degrade inter-port isolation and create ground loops.
- **USB 3.x:** standard USB 2.0 CMCs destroy SuperSpeed signal integrity. Use Murata DLW21HN or TDK ACM2012H within 15 mm of connector. Separate 2.0 and 3.x pairs with independent CMCs.
- **HDMI / DisplayPort:** CMC on each TMDS/ML lane pair, 90 ohm CM at 100 MHz, DM insertion loss < 0.5 dB at signal frequency. TDK MAF for space-constrained designs.
- **Camera MIPI CSI-2:** LC composite filters (Murata NFE61P) on each data lane pair. Place at receiver end (SoC side) to prevent noise coupling along flex cable. 4-circuit array filters for 4-lane CSI.
- **SPI/I2C off-board:** ferrite bead + TVS on each line. SPI clock > 10 MHz: add 33-100 pF cap after the ferrite -> `interfaces/spi.md`, `interfaces/i2c.md`.
- **General rule for high-speed differential:** always verify DM insertion loss at actual data rate. A CMC that fixes EMI at 200 MHz but adds 3 dB loss at 5 GHz will cause bit errors.

### Compliance Testing

- **Pre-compliance scanning saves weeks.** Scan at 1-5 mm distance -- H-field probes localize current loops, E-field probes localize voltage nodes. Lab compliance testing costs $5K-15K per round.
- **Clock harmonics dominate radiated emissions.** 25 MHz crystal has significant energy at 75, 125, 175 MHz. SSC reduces peaks ~6-10 dB but SSC is incompatible with USB (<500 ppm clock accuracy) -- SSC only on internal clocks.
- **Via fence around board edges and I/O connectors:** ground vias at <= lambda/20 spacing (at 1 GHz: <= 15 mm). Additional stitching vias from top-layer ground to ground plane within 5 mm of every connector.
- **Design for rework:** on first prototypes, add unpopulated footprints for series resistors on clock outputs, ferrite beads on power inputs, CM chokes at connectors. 0-ohm pads cost nothing but save a board respin.
- **Near-field probe sets:** Langer RF-B 3-2 (H-field 1-25 mm + E-field, ~$800). Beehive Electronics 100 series (~$300).
- **Pre-compliance spectrum analyzers:** tinySA Ultra (100 kHz - 5.3 GHz, ~$130, not calibrated -- relative comparisons only). Rigol DSA815-TG (9 kHz - 1.5 GHz, ~$1200, CISPR QP detector). Siglent SSA3021X (9 kHz - 2.1 GHz, ~$1500, built-in EMI detector).

## Common Mistakes

- **Unbalanced filter on a balanced system.** Forces mode conversion -- DM noise becomes CM, making emissions worse. The fix seems counterintuitive: balance the filter, not the source.
- **3-terminal cap with vias too close together.** Capacitive coupling across cap body bypasses the filter -- performance drops from ~100 MHz to ~10 MHz. Fix: input/output vias on opposite sides of the cap body.
- **Heatsink acting as antenna.** E-field coupling from IC package drives the heatsink; 1 mV at resonance can fail radiated emissions. Grounding the heatsink needs very low-impedance bond at GHz -- often harder than just minimizing heatsink size and routing signals below top ground plane.
- **Filter inductor too close to SMPS power inductor.** Transformer coupling bypasses filter attenuation. Symptom: conducted emissions show no improvement despite adding pi-filter. Fix: orient perpendicular, place outside GND ring.
- **Near-field probe scan at wrong distance.** H-field probes must be within 1-5 mm. At 10 mm+ resolution is too poor to identify hot loops. Fix: smallest H-field loop (Langer RF-B 3-2) at 1-2 mm, board at full load.
- **CMC dot convention reversed in schematic.** Dots on opposite sides makes the coil block differential signals instead of common-mode noise. On USB/HDMI this kills the data link entirely. Fix: dots on the same side for both windings; verify against datasheet equivalent circuit.

## Formulas

**Shielding absorption loss:**
**Rule of thumb:** 1 skin depth = 8.7 dB absorption. 2-mil copper > 60 dB at 100 MHz.
**Formula:** A(dB) = 8.7 * (t / delta), where delta = 1 / sqrt(pi * f * mu * sigma)
**Example:** 2-mil copper (50.8 um) at 100 MHz (delta = 6.7 um) -> A = 8.7 * (50.8 / 6.7) = 66 dB.

**Waveguide below cutoff (aperture attenuation):**
**Rule of thumb:** Depth-to-width ratio of 3:1 adds ~90 dB per aperture when f << fc.
**Formula:** Attenuation(dB) ~ 30 * (d/a) * sqrt(1 - (f/fc)^2), where d = depth, a = max dimension, fc = v/(2a). Does not apply if a wire penetrates the opening (TEM mode propagates).
**Example:** 5 mm deep, 2 mm wide hole at 1 GHz: fc = 75 GHz >> 1 GHz, attenuation ~ 30 * (5/2) * 1 = 75 dB.
