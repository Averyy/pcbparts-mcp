# Verified Design Rule Sources

382 sources across 41 topic files. 352 after cleanup (Mar 2026), then +30 gap-fill sources across 9 topics (audio, test-debug, fpga, can, isolation, adc-dac, thermal, ethernet, esp32) = 382. Every source is free, no paywall.

## How to Use This File

Each design rule file has a curated list of sources ranked by priority. When writing a rule file, start with Source 1 and work down. Sources are chosen for:

1. **Trustworthiness** -- manufacturer app notes, official specs, established educational sites
2. **Extractability** -- **strongly prefer HTML sources**. PDFs are acceptable only when no HTML alternative exists. HTML extracts cleanly and preserves tables/structure. TI PDFs that resolve via `ti.com/document-viewer/lit/html/{DOCID}` count as HTML.
3. **Educational value** -- teaches the "why", not just the "what"

### Platform Extractability Guide

| Platform | Method | Quality |
|----------|--------|---------|
| TI App Notes (HTML) | HTML via `ti.com/document-viewer/lit/html/{DOCID}` | EXCELLENT -- ~36% of docs, structured tables/sections. **Preferred** — extractor auto-probes HTML first. |
| TI App Notes (PDF) | PDF via `ti.com/lit/an/{docid}/{docid}.pdf` | HIGH -- predictable URL pattern, fallback only when HTML unavailable |
| ADI App Notes | HTML via `analog.com/en/resources/app-notes/an-{N}.html` | EXCELLENT -- structured HTML, best for LLMs |
| ADI Technical Articles | HTML via `analog.com/en/resources/technical-articles/{slug}.html` | EXCELLENT |
| Espressif HW Guidelines | HTML via `docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-hardware-design-guidelines/en/latest/{chip}/` | EXCELLENT -- Sphinx/RST, 10 chip variants, 4 pages each (schematic-checklist, pcb-layout-design, download-guidelines, resources). Old ReadTheDocs site renders clean HTML; new CDP site is a JS SPA (unusable for extraction). |
| Espressif ESP-IDF Docs | HTML via `docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/{chip}/...` | EXCELLENT -- peripheral HW notes, SD pull-up requirements |
| Espressif Chip Errata | HTML via `docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-chip-errata/en/latest/{chip}/` | HIGH -- known silicon bugs + workarounds |
| Raspberry Pi Docs | PDF via `datasheets.raspberrypi.com/{chip}/{doc}.pdf` | HIGH |
| SparkFun Learn | HTML via `learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/{slug}` | EXCELLENT -- CC BY-SA 4.0 |
| All About Circuits | HTML via `allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/{slug}/` | EXCELLENT |
| Nexperia App Notes | HTML interactive notes or PDF via `assets.nexperia.com/...` | MIXED |
| ST App Notes | PDF via `st.com/resource/en/application_note/{filename}.pdf` | GOOD -- website is JS-heavy, direct PDF only |
| Murata Articles | HTML via `article.murata.com/en-us/article/{slug}` | HIGH |
| Infineon App Notes | PDF via `infineon.com/assets/row/public/documents/...` | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| Altium Resources | HTML via `resources.altium.com/p/{slug}` | EXCELLENT -- well-structured articles, many by Lee Ritchey and Zachariah Peterson |
| LearnEMC | HTML via `learnemc.com/{topic}` | EXCELLENT -- Dr. Todd Hubing, gold standard for free EMC education |
| Henry Ott Consultants | HTML via `hott.shielddigitaldesign.com/techtips/{slug}.html` | EXCELLENT -- lightweight HTML, the EMC authority |
| Sierra Circuits | HTML via `protoexpress.com/blog/{slug}` or `/kb/{slug}` | EXCELLENT -- manufacturer perspective with concrete numbers |

> **Format policy:** Strongly prefer HTML sources over PDFs. PDF extraction via pdfplumber is adequate but loses table structure and figure context. HTML extracts cleanly with no artifacts. When adding new sources, always check if an HTML version exists before falling back to PDF.

**Cross-ref:** ADI AN-960 (RS-485/RS-422 Circuit Implementation Guide) already cited in `interfaces/uart.md` #6 — covers non-isolated RS-485 fundamentals. TI SLLA272 (RS-485 Design Guide) already cited in `interfaces/uart.md` #7. For CAN bus isolation specifically → see `interfaces/can.md` #7 (SLLA486). For ESD protection on isolated interfaces → see `protection/esd.md`.

**Key teaching points:** #1 is the comprehensive digital isolator design guide (edge-based vs OOK architectures, isolated SPI/I2C/UART applications, EMC-optimized PCB layout with split ground planes). #2 is the definitive optocoupler-vs-digital-isolator comparison (switching speed, TDDB lifetime, power consumption, integration level). #3 provides complete isolated RS-485 reference designs with SN6505B transformer driver for isolated power — the best single source for "how to build an isolated RS-485 node." #4 is the gold standard for creepage/clearance (IEC 60664 flowcharts, material groups/CTI, pollution degrees, overvoltage categories, worked examples). #5 is essential for isolation barrier PCB layout (split ground planes, stitching capacitance, edge guarding, CISPR 22 Class A/B measurements). #6 is the isoSPI reference for BMS applications (LTC6820 + pulse transformer, daisy-chain topology, twisted pair up to 100m).

Per-IC decoupling capacitor selection → see `power/decoupling.md`. SPI flash interface protocol → see `interfaces/spi.md`. Oscillator PCB layout → see `misc/crystal.md`.

**Note on Lattice URLs (#1, #2):** The official Lattice `view_document?document_id=` endpoint is broken as of Feb 2026 (returns wrong documents or redirects to product pages). These are the official Lattice technical notes hosted at a community mirror (0x04.net/~mwk) maintained by open-source FPGA toolchain developers. Source #3 uses the Lattice CDN hash URL which still works.

**Key teaching points:** #1 is THE primary ECP5 hardware reference (used in ULX3S, OrangeCrab, Glasgow, Cynthion): power sequencing (VCCIO before/with VCC and VCCAUX), decoupling per rail (100 nF per pin + bulk), SPI flash configuration pins, sysIO banking rules, SERDES rail filtering, JTAG, unused pin handling. #2 is the iCE40 equivalent (iCEBreaker): PLL analog supply isolation, SPI flash 0x0B Fast Read requirement. #3 covers SERDES analog design: CML buffer architecture, quiet supply with ferrite bead + cascaded caps, AC coupling cap values (20 nF min for 8b10b). #4 covers 4 sequencing techniques: RC time constant, PGOOD cascading, analog sequencer (LM3880), digital PMBus monitor (UCD90120A). #5 is the practical BGA layout starting point: stackup formula (signal layers = BGA rows / 4), NSMD vs SMD pads, dogbone vs via-in-pad by pitch, decoupling on BGA backside.
